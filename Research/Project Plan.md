# ðŸšŒ Pre-Production Research: Smart Public Transport App

## Problem
- Indian public transport = fragmented, unreliable schedules, poor last-mile connectivity.  
- Global apps (Moovit, Citymapper) exist, but not optimized for Indian conditions.  

## Existing Apps
**Moovit** â†’ Accurate routing, real-time tracking, works in Ahmedabad.  
- Weakness: wrong pricing, no UPI/ticketing, poor tier-2/3 coverage.  

**Citymapper / Transit** â†’ Good UI, multimodal planning.  
- Weakness: not localized for India.  

## Data Sources for India
- Govt feeds (GTFS/APIs) â€“ metro, BRTS, RTOs.  
- GPS tracking â€“ buses & fleets.  
- Crowdsourcing â€“ users report delays, crowding.  
- Mapping APIs â€“ OpenStreetMap, Mapbox.  
- Payments â€“ UPI, Metro cards, NCMC.  

## Proposed Solutions
- Unified data layer (GTFS + GPS + crowdsourcing).  
- Walkability & last-mile scoring (footpath, autos, e-rickshaws).  
- Safety & accessibility (women-friendly, wheelchair routes).  
- UPI integration for tickets & passes.  
- Gamification â†’ rewards for eco-friendly travel.  

## Research Points
- Reliability of GTFS in India.  
- Best way to incentivize crowdsourcing.  
- How to integrate fragmented ticketing systems.  
- Data privacy & govt ownership.  
- AI for predicting delays.  

## Conclusion
Moovit shows whatâ€™s possible, but it fails on Indian-specific needs.  
**Our app = India-first, govt-integrated, localized, safe, and payment-enabled.**
