Moodboard: Public Transport App
===============================

This folder is for collecting UI design inspirations, feature ideas, videos, notes, or useful links. Think of it as our shared "inspiration dump" for the project.

How to Add Items
----------------

You can add:

*   **Images:** UI screenshots, design examples
    
*   **Text files (.txt or .md):** with links or short notes
    
*   **Videos (link in a text file):** Don't upload heavy files; just add the link.
    

Naming Rules
------------

*   Use clear, descriptive names so everyone understands quickly.
    
*   Suggested format:
    
    *   navigation-sidebar.png
        
    *   dashboard-cleanui.jpg
        
    *   ticket-booking-flow.txt (with a YouTube or UI reference link inside)
        
    *   gamification-idea.md (with notes on the feature)
        

Avoid names like: image1.png, note.txt, or random.jpg.

Guidelines
----------

*   Keep this folder only for references and inspirations.
    
*   Use proper file names so others don't need to open every file to know what it is.
    
*   Add a short description inside .txt or .md files if it's not an image.
