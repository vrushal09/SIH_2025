- **Surat (SRT)**: 50+ stations with accurate positioning
- **Total**: 340+ stations across all three cities

#### ✅ **Multi-Source Coordinate System**
1. **Comprehensive Database**: Primary source with 150+ verified coordinates
2. **Manual Mapping**: Secondary fallback with high-accuracy locations
3. **Google Maps API**: Real-time geocoding with 4-level query strategies
4. **Intelligent Fallback**: City-center positioning for unresolved stations

#### ✅ **Enhanced Verification System**
- **Verified Stations**: Manually confirmed Google Maps coordinates
- **Estimated Stations**: Intelligent positioning based on area patterns
- **Station Types**: Categorized by function (educational, commercial, industrial, etc.)
- **Quality Control**: Coordinate bounds validation and accuracy tracking
